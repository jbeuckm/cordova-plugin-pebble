/**
 *  Represents a Pebble watch.
 *
 *  On iOS, there is the notion of a "communication session" between an app and
 *  the Pebble watch. You can imagine this as a "data pipe" directly from the
 *  watch to your app. However, there is only one session for 3rd party apps.
 *  This one session has to be shared among all 3rd party apps that want to
 *  communicate with Pebble (excluding the official Pebble iOS app).
 *
 *  Unfortunately, the session can only be opened from the phone app. This means
 *  that the iOS app has to start talking to the watch first to open the
 *  communications channel; the other way around is not possible.
 *  Most methods in the PBWatch categories (Ping), (Version), (Sports), (Golf)
 *  and (AppMessages) all implicitly open the shared communication session.
 *
 *  Lastly, iOS provides no good way to manage how the one shared session is
 *  accessed or used. Simply, the last iOS app to try to open it, wins and gets
 *  to use it. Therefore, it is important that your iOS app does **not** try
 *  communicate when a Pebble is connected.
 *
 *  When the user has stopped using your app (e.g. when going to the background
 *  or when explicitely stopping a certain activity in the app) your iOS app
 *  should close the communication session using the -closeSession: method.
